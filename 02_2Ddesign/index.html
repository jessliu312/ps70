Original Inspiration: a cute take-out box!

But, once I got working in Fusion, I started playing around with it and found that a semi-circle might work better than a rounded triangle for the lid. 

I ran into some troubles working on the lines as they kept turning blue. However, I realized that was because I was deleting the measurements as it was cluttering up the screen. 

While I was playing around with the lid, I found the ellipse function and copy & pasted it in 8 different angles to make a flower. I thought that this could be a cute addition to the box and so I added it as a ventilation system in case I need to air out whatever goes into the box.

Then, I was inspired by the box that Nathan made and loved the look of the interlocking tabs. However, I wondered if there  was an easier way to make them: I didn't want the base to be unsteady and consisting of interlocking tabs. Hence, I gave my box the appearance of it by only making the visible edges consisting of interlocking tabs. It took me a while to figure out the new "rectangular pattern" function and make sure that everything was equal distance from each other.

A few problems that I encountered:
<ul>
  <li>Size: I initially made a 150mm x 200mm box but in Rhino, I scaled it down to fit it onto the cardboard piece that I found. It turned out to be much smaller than I anticipated so I had to re-print the box. </li>
  <li>Scoring: The second time I printed, it was the right size; however, I forgot to delete duplicate lines which meant that the faces on the cardboard was double-scored and ended up just being cut out. Hence, I had to use hot glue to put everything together.</li>
  <li>Latch: measuring out where it should be took a bit of tinkering. Also, the laser cutter had cut out the tab that was supposed to be scored. I was able to fix it by using a little bit of duct tape. Usually, boxes would have 4 flaps on the top to ensure that the top of the box is fully covered. However, when I tried with 4 flaps, since the cardboard was so thick, it looked clunky and was difficult to secure with a small tab. </li>
  <li>Holes: I wanted my box to have a little more ventilation so I played around with the ellipse in Fusion and made a little flower as the ventilation hole pattern.</li>
</ul>

Here's the final product:

<div class="text-box">Modelling items in my room! </div>

My first item is a lip gloss! It took a while for me to figure out how to mold the applicator (as you can see in the image to the left). Eventually, I was able to figure out how to create the smooth shape of the applicator. After trying out stretching faces of the sphere, pulling out bits of a cylinder, I settled on a 3D extrusion of an ellipse that I built out of a sketch. For next steps, I'd like to learn how to mold this into a more natural, smooth-looking shape.

My second item is a small spoon. I watched a tutorial on Autodesk to learn how to manipulate faces better. This tutorial showed me the cool applications of how to use the modify tools and separate body control from face control. Using body control, I was able to contort the sphere into a flatter elliptical shape. Then, using face control, I selected two faces and elongated them to create the unnatural point that spoons have. This was something I learned going from the first household item to the second one. Now, I can make very irregular shapes starting from the base of a sphere. 

Then, I thickened the spoon and set the setting to be soft, giving it this smooth, malleable appearance. For the handle, I could not figure out the proper extrusion that would allow me to model out the exact curvature of the spoon's handle. For now, I created an ellipse in a 2d sketch, then extruded it to create the handle. I'd like to figure out how to smooth out the curve of the spoon to the handle so it seems less disconnected.
