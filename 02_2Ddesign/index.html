Original Inspiration: a cute take-out box!

But, once I got working in Fusion, I started playing around with it and found that a semi-circle might work better than a rounded triangle for the lid. 

I ran into some troubles working on the lines as they kept turning blue. However, I realized that was because I was deleting the measurements as it was cluttering up the screen. 

While I was playing around with the lid, I found the ellipse function and copy & pasted it in 8 different angles to make a flower. I thought that this could be a cute addition to the box and so I added it as a ventilation system in case I need to air out whatever goes into the box.

Then, I was inspired by the box that Nathan made and loved the look of the interlocking tabs. However, I wondered if there  was an easier way to make them: I didn't want the base to be unsteady and consisting of interlocking tabs. Hence, I gave my box the appearance of it by only making the visible edges consisting of interlocking tabs. It took me a while to figure out the new "rectangular pattern" function and make sure that everything was equal distance from each other.

Now, I'm going to hope that the interlocking tabs hack works......

My first item is a lip gloss! It took a while for me to figure out how to mold the applicator as it is angled and slightly elliptical. After trying out stretching faces of the sphere, pulling out bits of a cylinder, I settled on a 3D extrusion of an ellipse that I built out of a sketch. For next steps, I'd like to learn how to mold this into a more natural, smooth-looking shape.

My second item is a little spoon! I watched a tutorial on Autodesk to learn how to manipulate faces better. This tutorial showed me the cool applications of how to use the modify tools and separate body control from face control. Using body control, I was able to contort the sphere into a flatter elliptical shape. Then, using face control, I selected two faces and elongated them to create the unnatural point that spoons have. This was something I learned going from the first household item to the second one. Now, I can make very irregular shapes starting from the base of a sphere. 

Then, I thickened the spoon and set the setting to be soft, giving it this smooth, malleable appearance. For the handle, I could not figure out the proper extrusion that would allow me to model out the exact curvature of the spoon's handle. For now, I created an ellipse in a 2d sketch, then extruded it to create the handle.
