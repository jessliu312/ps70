I envisioned a curtain mechanism where I could draw open a curtain similar to the effect of this GIF.

<p class = "margin"></p>

<image style = "width: 30%" src = "curtain.gif" alt = "draft"> </image>
<br>

But, after spending a few days fiddling around with the prototypes, I found it really difficult to make something that could extend and retract far enough. I also found that the rings on my curtain wouldn't return to its original position, making it a difficult feat to retract something that is already in a retracted state. Overall, there were many issues with the way I designed this and after many iterations of changing materials and designs, I realized I needed something that I could tackle more efficiently.

I decided to still keep the original mechanism with a turning wheel attached to a moving arm. I realized that it looked a lot like the wheels of a bike so I decided to make a kinetic sculpture of a cyclist. 
<br>
Here's what I printed in Fusion!
<br>
<image style = "width: 50%" src = "fusion.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
<br>
I made several iterations, changing wheel sizes, materials, and positions of parts.
<ul>
  <li>It took me a while to find the optimal wheel sizes that looked aesthetically pleasing and also were big enough to accommodate for all the attachments I was going to place onto it such as the bike pedal. </li> 
  <li>Initially, I used a straw as the axle for the first wheel that was attached to the motor. However, because the motor was so powerful and the straw was weakened by the hot glue used to attach it, it would come apart after a few spins. To protect the structural integrity, I switched over to using wooden dowels. </li>
  <li>When all the parts were assembled and I started the motor, it seemed that the knee of the cyclist was going backwards. I had to find the optimal angle to glue the foot to the pedal in order for the joints of the cyclist to move in the right direction. I also had to play around with how tightly I secured the joints. I found that I needed to secure the ankle and hip joint tightly, but the knee joint needed to be loose.</li>
</ul>
Here's the final product:

  Video of moving cyclist

Here is the front and side view:

<br>
<div class="text-box">Areas for Improvement:</div>
<br>
<ul>
  <li>Second wheel: as you can see in the video, although the leg of the cyclist moves properly, the second wheel does not make the full 360 rotation. I think it is a problem with the pedal piece. It could either be too loose or the hole for the axle may be too large, allowing the wheel to move much more freely than I want it to.</li>
  <li>Motor: I want the motor to spin slower as this looks like a speed racer and I'm worried that the wheels will fly off.</li>
  <li>Background: I think it'd be so cool to have a background that moves so it looks like the cyclist is actually moving!</li>
</ul>
