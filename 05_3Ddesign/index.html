I started with the idea of making a fidget toy, however, given my limited experience, I wanted to try something that could not be easily made through subtractive methods that could gurantee some degree of print success. I was inspired by a jellyfish keychain that I saw and decided to make a good 'ol chain. 

Here's the process I took to make it:
<ul>
  <li>1. I started off building a center slot that was 20mm from each circle center and 20mm in height and a corresponding smaller slot with a 10mm height. Then, I tried extruding to make it a thicker chain shape. I was able to smooth this out  </li>
  <image style = "width: 40%" src = "chain.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem: I don't think this can stand on the print surface because I had filleted out the sides but even then, the chains would need to be at a non-90-degree angle on the print board. </li>
    <image style = "width: 40%" src = "filleted.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
  </ul>
  <li>2. I tried again except taking an octagon extrusion because it's inner angles are all 45 degrees. Shoutout to geometry class. I also exported it into Prusa Slicer and realized the individual chain was way too big and I wanted to make more of them interlocking so I reduced to the dimensions to 10mm by 10mm.</li>
  <image style = "width: 40%" src = "sketch.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
  <li>3. To make the chains interlocking, I needed to find a way for them to print without touching each other but also have enough support on all sides. Hence, I turned all the chains on a 45 degree angle so they interlocked at a 90 degree angle and all chains would have a surface touching the print surface.</li>
  <image style = "width: 40%" src = "crosssection.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
  <li>Here's what it looked like in Prusa. A little janky with all the supports, but better than the other orientations I could think of.</li>
<image style = "width: 30%" src = "prusa.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
<br>
</ul>




Here's what the final product looked like after an hour of removing the supports. I also learned that with dimensions this small, the octagonal shape doesn't even translate and it was just printed as a smooth circular tube.

<div class="text-box"> Taking a 3D scan of objects </div>
<p class = "margin"></p>

I decided to experiment with what my phone could capture. I downloaded Polycam -- something I could access on my phone and on my laptop!

I first made a pyramid of these balls I found in my pencil case and scanned it in the photo booth in class. I also tried again in my dorm room with a little beach hat. 

I learned that the background is so important because the camera picked up on even the texture of the flat surface in the photobooth. When I did it with paper, it also kept sliding as I moved around it so I eventually gave up and just used a flat, solid surface.

<image style = "width: 30%" src = "pyramid.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
<image style = "width: 30%" src = "hat.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>
<image style = "width: 30%" src = "hat2.jpg" alt = "draft"> </image>

If I were to do it again, I would place these on surfaces that I can access all 360 degrees around instead of having to manuever awkwardly because it made the back side of these scans turn out a little wonky. I also tried putting up a vertical white backdrop, but it seems like it actually interfered with the scan more. Perhaps there is some type of post-scan treatment that can help alleviate the lack of clarity in some areas of the scan.
