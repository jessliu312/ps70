When I saw the force-sensitive capacitors, I immediately thought of the game at the arcade where a square on the floor lights up as you step on it. Hence, I set out to create that.

<br>
<br>
First, I fiddled around with the copper pieces, trying to find a piece of foam just thick enough so that the it wouldn't short. Then, I used the serial data plotter to monitor how much force I was putting onto it. I set that as my if condition in arduino and wrote the code for a blue LED to light up if the force level was reached.

<br>
<br>
I learned a lot about circuits this time around because both the capacitors and the light bulb needed resistors and I had to organize the circuit in a way where the LED and the copper pieces could still get the voltage they needed. I also struggled with the foam in the middle as I thought my code wasn't running for a good 1 hr until someone pointed out that my circuit was probably just shorting because the foam I had was too thin. I found the connection to also sometimes be a little finnicky so I added a half-second delay from touch for the LED.
<br>
<br>

This was the final product that I achieved!
