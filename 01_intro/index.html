Hi! Welcome to my page where I'll be documenting my learnings throughout this semester! Building this page took a little getting used to as I pulled out VS Code for the first time in a good while. Here are some ideas that I'm thinking about for my final project! 
<p class = "margin"></p>

<p class = "margin"></p>
<div class="text-box">Posture Corrector</div>

<style>
    .text-box {
        display: inline-block;
        padding: 10px 15px;
        border: 2px solid rgb(201, 74, 140);
        border-radius: 5px;
        background-color: rgb(243, 181, 218);
        font-size: 16px;
        font-weight: bold;
    }
</style>

I tend to spend a lot of my time sitting at a desk and often with a non-standard sitting posture. Maybe I'm hunched over my laptop or I'm crossing my legs. These small habits can create long-term damages to spines, hips, and just general mobility. I'm thinking of solving this by creating a system of sensors that can be built into a chair to remind us with specific audio cues on what we should fix about our posture. I'm thinking some kind of weight sensor to determine if you're sitting cross-legged or with a leg up on the chair. I think I could also put in some kind of light/laser monitor on the seat of the chair that can monitor if you're hunched over. There could also be a possibility of making it a wearable sensor as well that could detect for things also beyond posture. I'll need to think through the exact functionality and design of this project, but I think it could be an interesting way to solve an increasing problem amongst our generation.

<div class="text-box">Audio Transcriber</div>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<br>

Sometimes I wish that I could get Echo/Alexa to write something down for me. I think it could be cool to get a type-writer-esque machine that could translate what you're saying into written text and physically type it out. It could help type out little notes or hand-written letters. It'd also be cool if I could customize a font for myself and it could write and sign exactly like me.

<div class="text-box">Collapsible Keyboard</div>
<p class = "margin"></p>
<br>

I was thinking about my keyboard and sometimes I wish that it was more portable. Also, as much as I love the clicky keyboards, after a while, it starts to hurt my wrist even with ergonomic designs. I wonder if there is a way to make a keyboard that just projects onto any flat surface like a desk and you can type as you would but it would register through finger patterns. Maybe that could be a way to eliminate typos too as the program learns which letters you have a hard time reaching. I think a projectable keyboard or at least something more compact could be something cool to build.
